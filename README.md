#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

I have been provided with the code for a restaurant reviews website that has a lot of issues. I updated the code to resolve the issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What did I do

1. In this folder, I started up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on local computer. Python helped me to do this. 

In a terminal, I used `python3 -m http.server 8000`. I have downloaded Python from this [website](https://www.python.org/) and installed the software.

2. With the server running, you can visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. I've implemented the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. I wrote the code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I replaceed `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
